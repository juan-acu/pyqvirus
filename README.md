# PyQVirus: Quantum Key Distribution Simulations

This repository contains Python simulations of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, specifically:

- **BB84** protocol
- **E91** protocol

These scripts allow users to experiment with secure quantum communication, including scenarios with and without eavesdropping.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
- Optional: virtual environment for dependency isolation

> The scripts currently rely only on standard Python libraries (no extra packages required).
